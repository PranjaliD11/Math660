```{r }
citibike<- read.csv("201611-citibike-tripdata.csv", header=T)
citibike.table <- table(citibike$Gender)
citibike.percent<-100*citibike.table/sum(citibike.table)
temp.name <- paste(format(citibike.percent, digits=3,trim=T), "%", sep="-")
citibike.names <- paste(names(citibike.table),temp.name)
pie(citibike.table, labels=citibike.names)
```
Q3.The graph of ages and number of riders is plotted below. Along with summary of the ages of the riders.It is observed that there are almost 96366 values left blank in the birth year coloumn.
```{r}
hist(citibike$Birth.Year, main="Number of riders v/s birth year")
citibike$age<-2022-citibike$Birth.Year
summary(citibike$age)
```

Q4. According to pie chart below we can conclude that almost 7.18% of the riders are non annual subscribers.

```{r}
citibike.table <- table(citibike$User.Type)
citibike.percent<-100*citibike.table/sum(citibike.table)
temp.name <- paste(format(citibike.percent, digits=3,trim=T), "%", sep="-")
citibike.names <- paste(names(citibike.table), temp.name)
pie(citibike.table, labels=citibike.names)

```
Q5.Different time plots are mentioned below. It can be noticed that people tend to buy 24hr passes more that 3 day passes.

rides_bikes<-read.csv("2016Q4-RidershipMembership.csv",header=T)
ts1=ts.plot(rides_bikes$X24.Hour.Passes.Purchased.Today)
ts2=ts.plot(rides_bikes$X3.Day.Passes.Purchased.Today)
```
Since values of trip duration vary a lot and with minimum value being 61 and max being 4319753,the histogram plotted below is of data between first and third quartile.
```{r}
summary(citibike$Trip.Duration)
hist(citibike$Trip.Duration,breaks=100000, xlim=c(369,1017))
```
Q7.Time plot of number of bike trips.
```{r}
ts3=ts.plot(rides_bikes$Trips.today) 
summary(rides_bikes$Trips.today)
```

```{r}
oct<-rides_bikes[1:31,]
hist(oct$Trips.today,breaks=10,main="Number of trips in Oct 2016")
hist(rides_bikes$Trips.today,breaks=10,main="Number of trips in 4th Quater of 2016")
